Definition of Machine Learning(ML)
1. Without being explicitly programmed.
2. ML is a discipline in which computers built data-based probabilistic statistical models and use them to predict and analyze data. Also called statistical machine leaning (统计机器学习).

The basic classification
1. Supervised leaning (SL, 监督学习): SL is a ML method in which the prediction models are acquired from labeled data.
2. Unsupervised leaning (USL, 无监督学习): USL refers to the ML problem of learning predictive models from unlabeled data.
3. Reinforcement leaning (RL, 强化学习): RL is a ML problem in which the intelligent system learns the optional behavior strategy through continues interaction with the environment.
4. Semi-supervised leaning (半监督学习), active leaning (主动学习).
